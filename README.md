# Search-And-Replace
RegEx Search &amp; Replace Extension for Chrome and Firefox browsers

## Project Specification

### Principal Goal

Develop a Chrome/Firefox browser plug-in to allow Search & Replace with regular expressions in text input fields of web pages.  

### Description

The project will develop a Chrome browser plug-in that would provide a search & replace functionality in text input fields of web pages. An important part of the project is to provide support for the use of popular regular expression constructs, a functionality which is missing in extensions available today. Other desirable features include:

- Ability to restrict search & replace to the current input field (i.e. where the cursor is) or run through all input fields on the page.
- Restrict search & replace to the selected text only
- Support for templates (i.e. a small "library" of commonly occurring patterns to search-and-replace with one click).

In addition to the software development work, it is expected that the student will do at least one round (ideally two) of user testing, collecting the feedback, and improving the tool based on the responses & bug reports. An ideal way to do this is by having a stable beta version of the plugin available on the Chrome Web Store well before the thesis is due.
