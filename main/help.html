  <div id="message">
    <h2>Welcome to Find &amp; Replace</h2>
    <h1>Help Text &amp; User Guide</h1>
    <div class="lead-para">Find &amp; Replace for Text Editing is a browser extension that allows
      you to search &amp; replace text in input fields and editable text content directly in
      your browser. <br /><br />
      Visit the <a href="https://find-and-replace-f6588.firebaseapp.com/">Official Website</a> to
      submit feedback or find more information.<br />
      We collect anonymous usage statistics to help improve the extension in the future.
      If you do not want to participate, follow the <a href="#s8-2">opt-out instructions</a>.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s1">1. Basic Usage</h3>
    <h4 id="s1-1">1.1. Selecting Target Text Area (optional)</h4>
    <div class="para">
      Before you open the extension, you should select the input area where you want to perform the
      search &amp; replace operation. By default, this extension works with any kind of <em>multi-line input
        area</em> (see link on how to <a href="#s4-3">include single-line inputs</a> in search).<br /><br />
      By default, the extension will select all text areas at once and perform the search across
      all of them. If however, you want to limit the search to a single input area, simply click
      inside it, before moving on to the <a href="#s1-2">next step</a>. If you have been typing
      text, it is already selected.
    </div>
    <h4 id="s1-2">1.2. Opening the Search Widget</h4>
    <div class="para">
      To launch the extension click on the icon that was added to your browser toolbar.
      <div class="img-row">
        <img class="framed" src="images/help/launch.png" />
        <img class="arrow-next" src="images/help/arrow-next.png" />
        <img src="images/icon32.png" />
      </div>
      You can also press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>
      (Mac: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>) to achieve the same effect,
      as long as there is no other browser extension using that shortcut.<br /><br />
      After opening the search widget, input areas selected in the <a href="#s1-1">previous step</a>
      (or by default all of them) should be indicated by showing a glowing outline.
    </div>
    <h4 id="s1-3">1.3. Finding Text</h4>
    <div class="para">
      After you open the search widget, you are presented with the following interface. If your status text
      indicates <em>No Target</em> (instead of <em>No Results</em>), see section <a href="#s1-1">1.1.
        Selecting Target Text Area</a>.
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/find-initial.png" />
      </div>
      You can start typing your search query into the <em>Find input field</em>, the text search
      results will be continuously updated as you type. You can see the total number of found occurrences
      as well as the current occurrence index in the status text. 
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/find-basic.png" />
      </div>
      All search results are highlighted directly in your webpage. The currently selected match is
      highlighted in different color. Click the <em>Up and Down</em> buttons to move the currently selected match
      to a match with a higher or lower index.
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/highlighting.png" />
      </div>
      When you click the <em>Replace</em> button, the currently selected match is replaced with the text in
      your <em>Replace input field</em>. You can also click <em>Replace all</em> to replace all occurrences at once.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s2">2. Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
    <div class="para">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Next match</strong> - Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> inside <em>Find input field</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Previous match</strong> - Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> inside <em>Find input field</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Replace</strong> - Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> inside <em>Replace input field</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Replace all</strong> - Press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> inside <em>Replace input field</em>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 id="s3">3. Search Options</h3>
    <div class="para">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Match Case</strong> - Indicates whether to search case sensitive. With this option
          turned on, the term <i>Cat</i> would only match <i>Cat</i> but not <i>cat</i> or <i>CAT</i> for
          instance.</li>
        <li><strong>Whole Words</strong> - When searching for an expression only those exact words with
          a word boundary will be marked. For instance, when searching for <i>auto</i> with this option
          turned on, <i>automobile</i> would not match, only <i>auto</i> on its own would.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Search</strong> - Expands advanced search options - see <a href="#s4">Advanced Search</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 id="s4">4. Advanced Search</h3>
    <h4 id="s4-1">4.1. Limiting Search to Text Selection</h4>
    <div class="para">
      Before being able to use the <em>In Text Selection</em> option, there must be a piece of text in
      your webpage that is currently selected (inside an input area). Once you have an active text selection,
      <a href="#s1-2">open your search widget</a> as usual (both clicking the icon and using keyboard shortcut
      preserve your text selection). Now your search matches will be restricted to your text selection.
    </div>
    <h4 id="s4-2">4.2. Using RegEx</h4>
    <div class="para">
      By turning on the <em>Use RegEx</em> option, the search will treat your search query text
      as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expression</a>. It will
      also enable you to see additional regex information relevant to your current match.<br /><br />

      You can replace parts of a regular expression with <em>capture groups</em>. You reference these capture
      groups in the <em>Replace input field</em> using the format <em>$n</em> (where n is a positive
      integer referring to the n-th capture group). You can also use <em>$0</em> or <em>$&amp;</em> to
      reference the whole matched string.
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/regex-demo.png" />
      </div>
      For example, the expression <strong>(\d*)/\d*/(\d{4})</strong> matches dates such as 3/8/2015.
      This expression has two capture groups: <strong>(\d*)</strong> matches the month
      and <strong>(\d{4})</strong> matches the year. <br />
      To replace each date matched with the above regular expression to the first date of the month,
      you would use the string <strong>$1/1/$2</strong>. The date 3/8/2015 would be replaced with 3/1/2015.
    </div>
    <h4 id="s4-3">4.3. Enabling Single-Line Inputs</h4>
    <div class="para">
      By default, this extension works with any kind of input area that spans multiple lines. This was
      an intentional design decision as having to search and replace text in single-line inputs is a quite
      rare use case.<br /><br />

      If you wish to do so, you can still include single-line inputs in your search by turning on the
      <em>Include Single-Line Inputs</em> option in the advanced search options.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s5">5. Using Favourites</h3>
    <div class="para">
      You can save search queries that you commonly perform to your Favourites list. When you have your
      search widget input fields set to certain values, you can click the star icon to save this search
      to your favourites.
      <div class="img-row">
        <img src="images/help/fav-step-1.png" />
        <img class="arrow-next" src="images/help/arrow-next.png" />
        <img src="images/help/fav-step-2.png" />
      </div>
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/fav-step-3.png" />
      </div>
      You can access your list of favourites using the right panel menu. By clicking on one of the items in
      the list you can restore your search input settings and perform the same search again. Note that this
      will only perform the search, but not the actual replace operation.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s6">6. Using History</h3>
    <div class="para">
      The extension automatically stores the history of your previous searches. A new history entry is
      only created when you perform at least one replace operation for the given search term.
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/history.png" />
      </div>
      You can access your history using the right panel menu. By clicking on one of the items in
      the list you can restore your search input settings and perform the same search again. Note that this
      will only perform the search, but not the actual replace operation.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s7">7. Using Templates</h3>
    <div class="para">
      Templates allow you to define a piece of text that you can later paste into your active input area.
      This could be your signature, a commonly used email response, or any other piece of text that you
      are going to reuse often.<br /><br />

      For this feature to work, you must first place your cursor into one specific input area on your page.
      The position of the cursor is important as it will indicate a position where the template is going
      to be inserted. If you instead select a piece of text with your cursor, the template will be inserted
      in the place of the selection as a replacement.
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/templates.png" />
      </div>
      You can access your templates using the right panel menu. By clicking on one of the items in
      the list you can perform the template insertion. You create new templates by clicking on the
      <em>Create New</em> button. Here you can also edit or remove existing templates
      by clicking on the edit icons next to each list item. Note that you can edit your templates
      anytime, even when you don't have an active input area selected.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s8">8. Using the Help Panel</h3>
    <h4 id="s8-1">8.1 Accessing the panel</h4>
    <div class="para">
      The help panel contains links to the official website, feedback forms, as well as a link to
      this help text. You can access the help panel using the right panel menu.
      <div class="img-one">
        <img src="images/help/help-panel.png" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h4 id="s8-2">8.2 Turning off Analytics</h4>
    <div class="para">
      We collect anonymous usage statistics to help improve the extension in the future. These reports are
      anonymized and contain information such as how frequently is the extension used, or which parts of
      the extension's user interface and functionality are used more often than others.<br /><br />

      We never collect your actual search queries or text that you are trying to find and replace. If you
      would still like to opt-out, you can do so by clicking on the on/off toggle labeled
      <em>Usage reporting</em> in the help panel.
    </div>
    <h3 id="s9">9. FAQ and Troubleshooting</h3>
      <h4 id="s9-1">9.1. My status text indicates <i>No Target</i></h4>
      <div class="para">
        Make sure you have followed all the steps in section <a href="#s1-1">1.1. Selecting Target
        Text Area</a>.<br />
        If you are dealing with a single-line input area, refer to <a href="#s4-3">section 4.3.</a> to see
        how to include single-line input areas in your search.
        If your input area is still not recognized by the plugin, please submit feedback with
        a link to the web page that was causing the trouble.
      </div>
      <h4 id="s9-2">9.2. My <i>In Text Selection</i> option has a red cross</h4>
      <div class="para">
        This indicates that you do not have a valid text selection that your search could be limited to.
        See section <a href="#s4-1">4.1. Limiting Search to Text Selection</a>
      </div>
      <h4 id="s9-3">9.3. My <i>Find input field</i> has a red outline</h4>
      <div class="para">
        This is most likely caused by trying to use an invalid regular expression during regex search. Make
        sure all your opening parentheses have a matching pair.
